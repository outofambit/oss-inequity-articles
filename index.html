  <h1>Inequity in open source labor</h1>
  <p>
    This is a small collection of articles about how structural inequality shows up in open source, focusing on labor
    and compensation.
    Essentially: why "anyone can join" isn't enough to product an accessible and equitable community.

    <h3><span class="article-title">The Dangers of Being Open</span> by Amira Dalla</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        But what happens when only certain people are able to contribute to open projects and what happens when only
        certain people are able to access open resources? This means that the movement is not actually open to everyone
        and only obtainable by those who can practice and access it. In parts of the world being open can mean people
        will steal your ideas which could negatively impact your livelihood. In other parts, being open means that you
        are a target for harassment or violence which could result in physical and emotional abuse. From my experience,
        it has become more apparent over the years that being open is actually not obtainable to the masses. That being
        open is something of a privilege. <em>That being open is actually elite.</em>

    <h3><span class="article-title">The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community</span> by Ashe Dryden</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        OSS contribution takes time; I don’t think anyone would contest that. Getting familiar with a project, finding
        out where you can fit into it, reading and responding to issues, testing and submitting patches, writing
        documentation. All of that requires a good deal of time.
        Marginalized people in tech - women, people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, and others -
        have less free time for a few major reasons: dependent care, domestic work and errands, and pay inequity.

    <h3><span class="article-title">Privilege, Communiy, and Open Source</span> by Jessica Lord</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In order to learn JavaScript and contribute to open source (getting that GitHub portfolio) I had to work nearly
        constantly. Wednesday mornings were the same as Saturday nights. For me all that suffered was my DIY blog. What
        if I had a parent, partner or child that depended on me? What if I couldn't move across the country or afford to
        take such a risk with finances? This dramatically cuts the pool of potential down to those who have monetary
        resources and little or no dependent obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making a living at open source is still more rare than the norm. How do people who don’t already have enough
        work constantly for nothing?
