  <h1>Inequity in open source labor</h1>
  <p>
    This is a small collection of articles about how structural inequality shows up in open source, focusing on labor
    and compensation.
    Essentially: why "anyone can join" isn't enough to product an accessible and equitable community.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    In early 2021, I wanted to start writing about structural problems with labor and equity in open source. In doing my
    research I was surprised to find that there isn't much writing on this topic readily available on the internet. I
    collected these articles (and added some notes) to organize my findings (and perhaps save other likeminded people
    some time in the future).
  </p>
  <p>
    I've intentionally left out academic journal articles (at least for now) to prioritize
    accessibility/approachability.

  <h3>Historical analyses</h3>

  <article>
    <h4><span class="article-title">Post-Open Source</span> by Melody Horn</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        the free software movement was on occasion writing actually good software; corporations saw that and wanted to
        get in on it without having to actually have principles. so they embraced the nominal goals of the free software
        movement and extended it into a more corporate-friendly movement with a larger pile of software to draw from.
        the conventional step after embrace and extend is, naturally, extinguish. the free software movement died long
        ago, in no small part due to its own mistakes, so there's not much left to extinguish. that which is being
        extinguished, that which died with mozilla, is the idea that the open source movement could have any other
        principles than corporate exploitation.

<h3>Barriers to entry</h3>

  <h4><span class="article-title">The Dangers of Being Open</span> by Amira Dalla</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      But what happens when only certain people are able to contribute to open projects and what happens when only
      certain people are able to access open resources? This means that the movement is not actually open to everyone
      and only obtainable by those who can practice and access it. In parts of the world being open can mean people
      will steal your ideas which could negatively impact your livelihood. In other parts, being open means that you
      are a target for harassment or violence which could result in physical and emotional abuse. From my experience,
      it has become more apparent over the years that being open is actually not obtainable to the masses. That being
      open is something of a privilege. <em>That being open is actually elite.</em>

    <h4><span class="article-title">The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community</span> by Ashe Dryden</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        OSS contribution takes time; I don’t think anyone would contest that. Getting familiar with a project, finding
        out where you can fit into it, reading and responding to issues, testing and submitting patches, writing
        documentation. All of that requires a good deal of time.
        Marginalized people in tech - women, people of color, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people, and others -
        have less free time for a few major reasons: dependent care, domestic work and errands, and pay inequity.

    <h4><span class="article-title">Privilege, Communiy, and Open Source</span> by Jessica Lord</h4>
    <p>
      Jessica Lord provides a very personal account of what she gave up to begin working in open source (and the
      privileges that allowed her to).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In order to learn JavaScript and contribute to open source (getting that GitHub portfolio) I had to work nearly
        constantly. Wednesday mornings were the same as Saturday nights. For me all that suffered was my DIY blog. What
        if I had a parent, partner or child that depended on me? What if I couldn't move across the country or afford to
        take such a risk with finances? This dramatically cuts the pool of potential down to those who have monetary
        resources and little or no dependent obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making a living at open source is still more rare than the norm. How do people who don’t already have enough
        work constantly for nothing?

<h3>Data</h3>

  <article>
    <h4>Open Source Survey</h4>
    <p>
      In 2017, GitHub (in partnership with external researchers) surveyed 6,000 people who work on or with open source
      software. This survey provided a rare quantitative snapshot of gender and race in open source communities. The
      numbers indicate that people in open source are overwhelmingly white straight cis men.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The gender imbalance in open source remains profound: 95% of respondents are men; just 3% are women and 1% are
        non-binary. Women are about as likely as men (68% vs 73%) to say they are very interested in making future
        contributions, but less likely to say they are very likely to actually do so (45% vs 61%).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1% of respondents identify as transgender (including 9% of women in open source), and 7% identify as lesbian,
        gay, bisexual, asexual, or another minority sexual orientation. 26% are immigrants (from and to anywhere in the
        world) and 16% are members of ethnic or national minorities in the country where they currently live.
      </p>
