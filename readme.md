In early 2021, I wanted to start writing about structural problems with labor and equity in open source. In doing my research I was surprised to find that there isn't much writing on this topic readily available on the internet. I collected these articles (and added some notes) to organize my findings (and perhaps save other likeminded people some time in the future).
